# 🚧 TODO Development

## Backlog

- 🟦 ❔ Ability to launch more containers of the same type (`--scale web=3` for example)

  May be it's not useful since you can create loops in your script. You can just
  do a loop and create yourself the names of the containers, adjust exposed
  ports as you wish. Adding scaling options would bring us back to a static
  model.

  Maybe we should better explain that in documentation for example.
